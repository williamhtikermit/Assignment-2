									<h1>Project Idea</h1>
								</header>
								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>Main goal or the idea of this project is to build Foodie which is an app to help personal gourmet or food lover to record and classify delicious food information which include the restaurant’s location and evaluate for restaurant food, the cooking method and food source for home cooking correct to every single dish name. Whenever the ideas come out, then you can directly find where or how to get a delicious food in the restaurant or cooking by yourself. Foodie dedicates to help people develop a habit that record and share their experience in specific way not only for the restaurant but also for single dish like food blogger and chef so that every people can become a senior gastronome when you share your experience with your friends or people want to make their life more colourful after a long-term accumulation by using Foodie. Moreover, Foodie will allow you to see and give the sense of idea what restaurant’s dishes look like in reality due to the AR function of the app.</p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>We are all food lovers in this group. Since our group is made up of people from different background and culture, we would like to share food, recipes, ideas, and local dishes among the group members. In our free time, we always try different delicious food in different cities and different means. We may have tasted and cooked for hundreds of foods during our free time. But most of us can only remember part of details for these foods or recollect some information from the old tweets and pictures. And we easily find a high-rated restaurant nearby, highlights of the restaurant and good cooking methods. However, that was not our own experience. We cannot just review our pictures or tweets over and over to recollect dish information that we have tasted to share or use. Meanwhile, it is not easier for amateur food lover to remember all the cooking experience by their own. So, we decide to solve these two problems in an app in this project because I service that most applications only provide comments or cooking methods respective.</p>
								<h2>Description </h2>
								<p>In Foodie, we decide to provide an innovative way to prepare or find a big meal for food lover using Foodie by a simple direct viewing, simplify use, strong yet minimal interactive user interface (UI). In Foodie, a big meal can be prepared or found from a detailed idea such a dish name, food name or flavour first, and we can add more details to filtrate the food which we want to eat in the meal. Then it can list all the relevant restaurant and cooking methods sort out by location, waiting time, price of materials or per capita, services, and means of purchase or even more. It maybe looks a little bit mussy, but we can set these screening approach into two main parts. So, the first part provides the basic function to encourage and help food lover to record the food experience by specific template which including the dish name, restaurant information, location, price, and comments for the restaurant food. Also, in second part, we want to combine the methods and food sources for home cooking with comments on restaurant food so that people can have more choices at the same time by using Foodie. Hence, another plate should be set as cuisine preparation in Foodie. This plate plan to add a special template to record the cooking methods with experience and the food source which including different suggestion purchase way, the method of preservation and some tips. To encourage people to use Foodie to gather more experience, we decide to add some function such as one-click upload to share the diet information on some mainstream social software which including Twitter, Facebook, WeChat Monuments and so on.</p>
								<p>Another function or feature, we would like to add to set apart from our competitors’ apps on the market is to add the Augmented Reality (AR) for the food. With this feature, restaurants can add the AR version of their plates in the app so that our users can have the idea of what restaurant’s dishes look like in reality. Users will be able to pick and select dishes posted by the restaurants and see the dishes with AR. Moreover, users or restaurant customers in general can know the amount of food in a dish. Users can also compare what restaurant’s dishes with their own version of the dishes when users try to replicate at home. All of these could be done via the AR function in the app.  </p>
								<h2>Tools+Tech</h2>
								<p>To improve competitiveness among application market, we also provide some optional function can be exploited. For example, we decide to add a healthy diet monitoring function which comes from the project in User-centred design to help people focus on their diet healthy while enjoying the food by using Foodie. The app may remind user to record or collect their physical health data such as weight, body fat, height, and gender or the dietary date which including type of food and the amount of the food from users when they are using this app so that the app can track the users’ health and provide the better intimate service and the humanize advises about the dietary choices. The MIT app inventor is a fully online development platform which can help us to build an app for IOS and Android operating system in 19 languages on the website by building blocks of stacking even our group member may did not know how to use computer programming. So, every group member can join to the creating for this app in their computers. However, there may have some functions in Foodie which are not easy to finish by the MIT app inventor individually. So, the python programming language is also a choice when we make this project. Also, the optional function needs to the data from the User-centre design. To complete this project, a computer and one mobile of IOS or Android are necessary. And some software like Vscode, GitHub, and MIT APP inventor can make our work more efficient.</p>
								<p>In the process of building Foodie, there are some necessary skills which including the basic programming ability for python and be skilled in using MIT APP inventor. For these two skills, the programming ability is one of the skills that we are learning and practice from the university course and the MIT APP inventor is a skill that can be study independently as a student. So, both two necessary skills are not difficulty to hold for basic using. However, it still not easy to be a really proven technique in these areas. It still needs us to work hard and practice constantly for a very long time in the future. By the way, there is another skill that is the skill that we are learning from the university which is User-centre design for optional function in Foodie. For the AR part of the food app, we believe we must use Augmented Reality software development kits (AR SDK). For instance, we can use SDK like Vuforia AR SDK since it supports on multiple platforms including mainstream platforms such as iOS and Android. It supports both cloud and local storage which is convenient for developers. For another option, we can use Apple ARKit from Apple, Inc. if we want to target iOS platform specifically. Apple ARKit would run efficiently if we use Swift as the main programming language for iOS platform.  </p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>If the project is successful, the best outcome is to give some food lovers or gourmets like us a good and more convenient way to record and enrich their experience and daily life by using these APP. Of course, Foodie can help to solve most of problems that caused by incommodity. This project is designed for some food lover at the beginning, but it also adds elements which can encourage people to develop habit and explore more in the food sector like a real gourmet.</p>
