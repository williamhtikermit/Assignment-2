								<h2>Cloud & Services</h2>
								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>Cloud is made up of global servers around the world acting as a one massive network. Cloud computing is the on-demand services on the internet of IT resources. Users do not need to own physical and maintaining data centers and servers or simple external or internal hard drive, users can access computing power databases and storages from the cloud providers (AWS.com, 2021). Although there are free cloud services from the providers, many cloud services like Office 365, Adobe or iCloud offers subscription-based services meaning customers are paying fees to use cloud monthly or annually. There are three main types of cloud computing such as Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service or Software as a Service. There are several popular cloud service providers (CSPs) on the market such as Apple, Google, Amazon Web Service (AWS) or Azure. In the past, people store the data on many physical storages such as hard drives, CD ROM, or the computer’s internal storages. Now, via the internet, people usually start using clouds mainly for online backup, storages, or data which has become the most common use among the users (Anurag, 2017). Apart from cloud storages and backups, clouds are used in business and other organizations for data analytics, software development and testing. In addition, cloud is used many popular and common as aspect in communication, productivity, or social networking. In communication, emails and calendars use clouds and many messaging apps are likely built on cloud infrastructures (Anurag, 2017). For instance, messages, photos, videos, or voice messages sent by the users are stored in data center of the provider rather than on your device’s main storage. Application from productivity section like Microsoft Office 365 service or Google Docs, Slides and Sheet has begun using clouds to offer the best productive workflow over the internet (Anurag, 2017). </p>
								<p> Cloud computing dates back all the way to 1963. In 1963, MIT is presented with the idea that allow at least two users to use a computer at the same time which required two million dollars funding by DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). This idea was the precursor to what has now become Cloud Computing (Foote, 2017). When ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) developed internet with the help of J. C. R. Licklider around 1969, it became important access to the cloud technology (Foote, 2017). In the early stages of cloud development in 70s, cloud is expressed as the empty space between end users and providers (Foote, 2017).</p>
							</p> As for the future of Clouds and its services, it will become more popular, competitive, expansive and the future of IT in a few years due to several reasons. As the cloud services are cheaper than physical servers, data centers, and network and many businesses having access to the internet, it is easier and cheaper to build infrastructure around cloud computing. This way, many organizations can save money significantly using cloud computing. Furthermore, cloud computing can help businesses and companies to the developments in newer market (Golden, 2021). </p>
							<h3>Impact</h3>
							<p>	Cloud can have several impacts on different aspects of today’s world, and it comes with potential advantages and disadvantages of using cloud. The main upside of using cloud and its related services is due its cost effectiveness. For instance, software using in a business can be stored in the cloud. This helps a business to reduce their software expenses (Singh, 2015). Businesses or normal users can easily store or backup their data without any extra effort. All the data will be stored in data center of the provider via the server. Moreover, users can easily recover their data in case of disaster, loss, or theft. Using clouds can be accessed anywhere from several options. They can access to cloud with their smart devices, increasing the efficiency of the workflow (Singh, 2015). However, using clouds come with disadvantages as well. The first main concern of using cloud is availability and connectivity of the Internet connection. People are unable to access to their data stored in cloud if they don’t have access to the internet or even with lower bandwidth (Singh, 2015). Another concern of using cloud is security issue since it is difficult to maintain cloud service and it is vulnerable to hackers’ threat (Singh, 2015). Cloud computing will not replace the jobs of IT. Cloud based skills will play the vital role in cloud technology world since large numbers of people will be affected by using cloud technology. However, current tech workers can add cloud-based skills to their skillset easily (Wolters, 2019). </p>
							<h3>Affect on Us</h3>
							<p>Cloud affects we the university students in several ways. We will use software provided by the RMIT University. We can access the software stored in the cloud without installing in our laptops or mobile phones. Moreover, we can our data in cloud storage system. Students with iPhone can use iCloud or Google Drive. RMIT University also provides access to OneDrive which is the online storage platform. We are also using services like Office 365 or Google Docs to collaborate on projects, reports, or writing. Moreover, students will use messaging app to communicate with their friends or family which is built around cloud infrastructure. In the time of global pandemic, cloud system plays the important. Due to COVID restriction, we the students are all over the places. To learn, we use cloud-based learning system like Collaborate Ultra or Microsoft teams as the virtual classroom video conferencing. </p>

							<h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>The blockchain is essentially a shared database, and the data or information stored in it has the characteristics of being unforgeable, open, and transparent, permanent preservation, and unchangeable. The biggest difference between it and other shared databases is that it is decentralized.
In 2008, a paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto described an advanced and perfect currency system, which was subsequently built by many system engineers. In January 2009, the Bitcoin system started operating, which was the earliest cryptocurrency. Up to now, there are more than five thousand cryptocurrencies in the world. The most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin and Ether.
Based on blockchain technology, the Ethereum function has been developed. The Ethereum blockchain has become the mainstream of current blockchain applications. It also has the characteristics of openness, transparency, and immutability. So, it has credibility, and it is called a smart contract. Such code is decorated with a beautiful interface and becomes a decentralized app, and finance-related applications are called decentralized finance, or simple DeFi. There are other applications in different fields implemented on Ethereum, Such as games, identity authentication, mortgage, securities, digital copyright spin-off, etc. Blockchain technology is spread to everyone's daily life through Ethereum.
The most important technology of Ethereum is smart contracts, which are used in securities, trade finance, financial derivatives, financial data recording, insurance, supply chain, mortgage, etc. In the securities field, smart contracts can simplify the management of capital tables, bypass middlemen, facilitate automatic payment of dividends, carry out stock splits and debt management, and can also reduce operational risks, and digitize work processes.
The Ethereum blockchain also has a non-fungible token (NFT) function. NFT is used to buy and sell artworks and collectibles. CHRISTIE'S, a traditional auction house, also accepts NFT payment methods. As a digital art trading platform, SuperRare provides artists with the best choice. Every sale of art will provide its creator with a certain commission. Unlike traditional auction houses, once the auction is successful, the appreciation of artworks has nothing to do with the creator. NFT can bring the greatest benefits to artists. Not only works of art but NFT can also be used in more fields. The NBA has introduced top shots of various players, and people can also trade with NFT.
</p>

							<p>Blockchain technology has been used in the banking industry. It is only used on a small scale now and will become more popular in the future. It will not only be used more widely but also cover more people. Visa Will Start Settling Transactions with Crypto Partners in USDC On Ethereum. (Fmgl.com.au. 2021)
Sharing economy: The decentralized characteristics of the blockchain are highly consistent with the purpose of the sharing economy. In the shared data ledger of the blockchain, the operation of the entire system is open and transparent, which will make the sharing economy easier. Tencent is applying smart contracts to bicycle rental, housing sharing, and other fields. (Harvard Business Review. 2021)
Cloud storage: Blockchain technology can support distributed storage of encrypted data and is the core of collaborative cloud storage. Its decentralization can prevent external attacks and malicious saboteurs inside the system. It can also generate and copy data without being affected when the network link is unstable. (Blockchain Support Center. 2021.)
In the future, blockchain will be applied to the charity industry, voting, public welfare industry, energy management, and other aspects. The charity industry and the charity industry are the industries that most need to be open and transparent. Blockchain can not only guarantee its needs but also will not be tampered with. Donors can easily check the flow of their funds, and anonymity can also protect the privacy of donors. Smart contracts need to be introduced to ensure usage rules.
Blockchain can be used in voter registration and identity verification. Creating an unalterable, publicly visible voting and ledger record can make elections fairer and democratized. If the 2020 presidential election in the United States uses blockchain technology, Trump will not need to ask some states to recount the votes.
Energy Internet has the characteristics of precise calculation, ubiquitous interaction, self-discipline control, optimized decision-making, and wide-area coordination, but it faces practical problems in every aspect. The successful operation of the Energy Internet must overcome the problems of various information interaction, smart grid control and dispatch, and the coordinated control of distributed power sources. Blockchain technology is trying to solve these problems. (ConsenSys. 2021)
</p>
							<h3>Impact</h3>
							<p>Cryptocurrency has brought about the booming development of the financial market, which is a big opportunity for the financial industry. The personal income tax on the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency has created a large amount of GDP for the government. Whether it's Bitcoin, Ether, or Dogecoin, which has been gaining momentum recently. Bitcoin can only be used to buy and sell in the financial market and cannot be used. Ether can already be used for item transactions. More and more cryptocurrencies may lead to the virtualization of global currencies, thereby replacing part of the banking business.</p>
							<p>The decentralized, immutable, open, and transparent attributes of the blockchain are destined to bring openness and justice to society and people and make up for the trust between people with people and people with large organizations. Blockchain will reduce transaction costs, transaction records can be automatically updated, saving intermediary fees. Transaction speed and price will increase, and transaction records can be updated almost in real-time. Data integrity is also preserved because of the immutability of the blockchain. (Revfin.org. 2021)
Once blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are mature and popularized in various industries, they will replace service personnel. Bank practitioners will be the first to bear the brunt. Due to the higher efficiency and lower cost of the blockchain, many industry practitioners will lose the job, and even many occupations will disappear. The most popular professions will be programmers, such as system engineers, software engineers.
</p>
							<h3>Affect On Us</h3>
							<p>Although blockchain technology is developing rapidly, the number of Ethereum users and daily transaction volume has increased tremendously, and the number of global cryptocurrency users exceeded 100 million in January 2021, it is still a long way from my daily life. My life will not be much different right now. There are no Ethereum users or cryptocurrency investors among my family and friends.
The emergence of blockchain technology and the speed of its development have threatened many kinds of jobs, and I realized this and chose IT as the major of my bachelor's degree. I hope that in the future I can become the creator of the times and not the obliterator.
Cryptocurrency brings investment opportunities to people, especially financial industry players. Mainstream cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become mainstream investment commodities like gold, real estate, and minerals. (Finextra Research. 2021) Especially Bitcoin, because of the constant quantity, the price has been rising since the Bitcoin system was launched in 2009, and at the end of 2020, the price of Bitcoin has risen sharply, with the highest price exceeding 83,000 Australian dollars. Although there is no limit on the number of Ether, since all applications on Ethereum use Ether for transactions, Ether is also very worth investing in. The investment risks of altcoins and air coins are very high. Once people stop buying, the price will collapse. Some of the top collections on the CRYTO SLAM website, such as NBA Top Shot, CrystalPunks, CryptoKitties, etc., have high sales. Although this is where there are many opportunities, there are also many bubbles. In recent years, I will not try to invest in cryptocurrency and blockchain. I hope that when they become more popular, I can catch up with this opportunity.

							<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p> Nowadays, with the development of our technologies people having much more convenient lives. In the past people sending letters with actual mails, people keep their precious stuff in the actual vaults, however, the letter may get lost in the middle of the way or stole by thief the properties like privacies information may not be able to store in the vault. But with modern techniques —the help of computer these things can be easily deliver to whatever you want. The emails are fast, the cloud services are simple to use, the digital currencies are convenient to store and spend, but the bad guys are always there, they just like the wolves in the wild they are looking for preys to attack, they always aiming for people’s precious properties. In the modern society they won’t use the old tricks in the 1800s, they are smart to use the thing that most of us use every day to rob your properties and the thing is computer.
  Computers had already developed into different forms than the giant monster when it was first born in the world. Three of the most popular forms of computers which we commonly use in our daily lives are desktops, laptops, and smartphones. With the help of internet, we use these devices to text our friends and families, use them to store, our files our information and making trades every day. The internet just like the highways in the digital world, provide roads for the information to travel but it also provides chances for the thieves and bandits. They can intercept your information or even go straight up to your computers; the user may not even know they got rob. However, cybersecurity just like the guards in front of your house and the police of the digital world it keeps fighting the crimes and protect your properties. </p>
							<p>  The starts of war of cyber security can be track back before the computer born. Radio can be seen as the predecessor of the internet, it commonly used in WWII, it contributed to the exchanging of the intel between Axis and Allies. The intel department of Axis and Allies are trying to figure out each other's moves they are monitoring each other’s radio frequencies and intercept the information. They try to use different kinds of encryptions to deliver their information and it is a way of reinforcing the cyber securities. The computer was born in this environment and its created aiming to decrypt the Intels of Axis.
  Since the first home computer came out, people start use it to chat and store files including their personal information. The internet thief can be call as a “hacker”, they stole people’s information and privacy with various goal, some for money and some for curious. At the early years, Because of the shortage of skills or the scorn of cybersecurity the cyber-attack was running wild. For example, in 1998 there are more than 250 thousand attempts try to breach into the Pentagon and over 60 percent was succeeded. (The FBI's Perspective on the Cybercrime Problem, 2021)
  People nowadays using smartphones and laptop most likely to communicate with others, and people put in their personal information into those social media applications. Their address, bank account, personal ID and other important information. The popular social media application like Facebook was breached by hackers and Facebook lost millions of users’ information and money within this breach out in 2019. (Tunggal, 2021) (Vigliarolo, 2021)
</p>

							<h3>Impact</h3>
							<p> After the appearance of digital currencies like bitcoin and the mobile payment system like Apple pay, Ali Pay the cyber security needs to be more efficient and secure. Unlike before, if a device or an account got hacked may directly cause the loss of user’s money. As we know most of the cyber-attack was coming from the internet with virus, Trojans, worn and other malware to invade people’s computer. It will be better to have a filter to filter out the bad things from the internet, and that’s what a firewall does, it just like a mask for filtering out the covid-19 virus. The firewall is a combination of the hardware and software it forms a security gateway between the local network and the internet it can efficiently stop illegal access. (What is a Firewall? 2021) The system can have a customized firewall, or the user can choose to use the firewall of the systems like the windows firewall. A customized firewall can be set to filter whatever the user wants to.  But for a normal computer user its better to use the firewall of the system companies.
  On another hand, it is also significant to secure the data that the users send out. The introduction of encryption technologies just like an armor for the transportation. The encryption technologies improve the systems and data’s security and privacy, It is an efficient method to prevent data leakage. Basically, the encryption is aiming to transform the data or message into a specific form (plaintext) that the receiver needs to use their private keys to decrypt the plaintext.
(Bradford, 2021) Others with no keys will not be able to read, in other words, the data become meaningless in their hand. The encryption techniques have been improving with the times, from the Caesar encryption to RSA, hash, ELGamal and digital signature. With each improvement the encryption became more and more secure. These encryption techniques are commonly using in data transportation and cloud services.
  Blockchain as a newly developing technology which brought lots of advantage to internet especially in the online trading. The cyber-attack not only about virus and trojans, it also including the actual stealing action on the online trading. For example, within a multiple online trading, one of the traders trying to cheat on others, he hacked into the central server and delete the trading history and try to extort others. Because the trading history was deleted, other traders may not have enough evidence. However, after the birth of blockchain, it solves this question. One of the out-standing features of blockchain is decentralization. It means there is no central authority (no central server), the blockchain technology is based on replicated across a peer-to-peer network, it makes the information very difficult to corrupt and extinguish. (Blockchain Technology Explained (With Infographics), 2021) With the help of blockchain, the cheater can’t completely destroy the history of trades. Blockchain makes everyone within the network become a supervisor. The traceability and security make blockchain a powerful weapon against cyber-attack. </p>
						<h3>Affect on Us</h3>
						<p>In my opinion, Cybersecurity has a very bright future, with the development of different IT technologies there are many areas that cybersecurity can cooperate with. For example, the combination with Artificial Intelligence. With the help of AI, it breaks the inherent ideas and the limitation of the algorithms. AI provides support on the computer systems by using smarter decision, and Ai having a much quicker responding and computing speed than human with make the system more efficient and secure. Another vital feature of AI is machine learning which provide system abilities to detect the high frequently appear virus or phishing software and automatically block it for user. The machine learning also give user chance to set up a suitable cybersecurity defender for themselves. With the cloud services technologies, the information of virus and malware’s information can be store and share by different firewall which can form a globally defender for hackers and virus.
  But these are the idealized situation, with the development of the cybersecurity in some extend the old hardware be able to adapt the changes because of the limitation of the computing speed and volume. Also, the machine learning may violate the privacy of the users, companies may sell those privacy for commercial uses which many of the internet company are doing right now. That strictly require the supervise of the government and people. For another, the competition for cybersecurity engineers will rise with times, internet companies will require engineers with talent algorithm skills and could make new security techniques.
  In conclusion, the development of internet and computers brought people convenience, but it also brought new crises.  The cybersecurity affects both society and economy, to keep safe internet environment is the responsibilities of everyone, to improve the cybersecurity is not only about improves the techniques but also need to improve the awareness of people who uses computers. Because now the rise of the focus of the cybersecurity, it is more important for us the analyse the issues and breaches then provide safer cybersecurity technologies to people.

						<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>Machine learning is a multi-field interdisciplinary subject, involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithm complexity theory and other subjects. Skills, reorganize the existing knowledge structure to continuously improve its own performance. On the other hand, machine learning is a science that allows computers to act without explicit programming. In the past decade, machine learning has brought us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a great understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so common today that you may use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. For example, Siri, Alexa, Google Now are all virtual assistants. As the name suggests, they will assist in finding information after using voice to give instructions. For answers, the virtual assistant will look up information, recall our related queries, or send commands to other resources (such as phone applications) to collect information. We can even instruct the assistant to perform certain tasks, such as "setting an alarm at 7 o'clock" and so on.

Nowadays, artificial intelligence makes it possible to predict the likelihood of a heart attack with much better accuracy than before. While manual systems can make correct predictions with around 30 percent accuracy, a machine learning algorithm created at Carnegie Mellon University was able to raise the prediction accuracy to 80 percent. In   a hospital, an 80 percent prediction theoretically would give a physician four hours to intervene before the occurrence of the life-threatening event. (Jonathan, 2021) At the same time, machine learning is also facing on teaching people to play instruments. For example, playing piano is one of the challenging abilities for people to learn due to it requires the good controlling of listening the sounds as well as very high finger proficiency.</p>

						<p>Toward many piano beginners, the biggest difficulty of "self-taught musical instruments" is that no one corrects the mistakes for you. When you’re not sure whether you’re playing correctly, it can be difficult to stay motivated to learn more. In this case, machine learning affords idea environment for people. Utilizing the essence of cutting-edge machine learning, machine learning-app allows its note recognition system to continuously learn, improve, and become more acute from different piano and electronic piano tones. The new technology also allows the app to be automatically learned from the user's experience, to continuously correct and improve the accuracy of identification. Therefore, the learners would find self-taught piano more interactive and interesting.</p>
						<p>If the model becomes more complex and built on richer algorithm primitives, then this increased complexity will require higher reusability between tasks, rather than whenever we have a new task or new data set Train a new model from scratch. In fact, many data sets will contain insufficient information to develop new complex models from scratch, so it is necessary to use information from previously encountered data sets. Just like you never learn English from scratch every time you open a new book, this is impossible. In addition, due to the large overlap between the current task and the previously encountered tasks, the model for training each new task from scratch is very inefficient. (Francois, 2017). In addition, a remarkable finding that has been repeatedly observed in recent years is that training the same model to perform multiple loosely connected tasks at the same time will result in a better model for each task. For example, training the same neural machine translation model to cover both English to German translation and French to Italian translation will result in a better model for each language pair. The image classification model and the image segmentation model are jointly trained, sharing the same convolution basis, and the resulting model is better for both tasks. and many more. This is intuitive: there is always some overlap of information between these seemingly disjointed tasks, so a federated model can access more information about each individual task than a model trained only for a specific task. </p>

						<h3>Impact</h3>
						<p>The field of ML has already been excavated a lot by mankind, and people’s lives have been potentially influenced by the field. To begin with, people are getting used to depend on machine and AI. Apparently, many years ago, when a smart phone has not been developed, people need to store, to write down and even to remember the address, phone numbers by themselves. However, the advent of Smart phone started a new era. People can casually store their information into their smart phones, asking Siri to help them figure out issues, such as searching address, phone numbers, or even chatting to reduce stress and anxiety. As the result, ML brings convenience, even health care for human. Secondly, ML can have a very deep effect on medical field. Both doctors and patients become the beneficiaries. As One of the chief ML applications in healthcare is the identification and diagnosis of diseases and ailments which are otherwise considered hard-to-diagnose. This can include anything from cancers which are tough to catch during the initial stages, to other genetic diseases. IBM Watson Genomics is a prime example of how integrating cognitive computing with genome-based tumour sequencing can help in making a fast diagnosis. (HEALTHCARE BPO, 2021). </p>
						<p>ML can do many works that people can do, but it will never replace human, or it will take a very long time. As we know that, machine learning is intelligent, the program, more precisely, the machine, is based on absorbing knowledge(output) that programmers input into them and make a program by themselves. Which means, for example, in term of manufacturing things, robot can be more efficient and precise to achieve the target than human, labours such as workers in factory, construction site are able to replace by Machine on doing some basic works. From the perspective of value, when the machine performs a specific job or a certain part of the task, the remaining tasks that can be completed by non-machine learning become more valuable. On the other hand, machines will increase human productivity and make it possible to produce brand-new products, services, and workflows. Therefore, in terms of the impact on labour demand, even for jobs that require machines, the impact of machine learning may be negative or positive. When machine learning systems are close to the capabilities of humans in certain positions, positions that complement these systems will appear. When machine learning systems are more cost-effective than humans, entrepreneurs or businessmen will naturally use machines to replace humans to maximize profits. In turn, this will increase productivity, lower prices, shift labour demand, and reorganize entire industries. (Erik, 2017)
</p>
						<h3>Affect On Us </h3>
						<p>For me, ML helps me to get rid of many troubles and brings me convenience. In my daily life, I like to play games, to listen music, and researching information, any of these are relevant with ML. For example, when searching the material that relevant with ML, I would type Machine Learning, Firstly, if I mistakenly type “machine kearhung” the result will still appear in “machine learning” which save times for me. Secondly, In the aspect of using music applications, When I want to get listen a song but with knowing the name of the song, partially humming the melody of the song is sufficient to solve the problem, Applications will intelligently search similar rhythm and show me the results. For my family, ML can have positive impact toward my aunt and my uncle. My aunt is disabled, her right arm and right leg are almost losing consciousness, which means, driving and working freely are impossible for her. In case of this, my uncle not only have to work every day to make money, but also need to take care of his wife and his daughter. However, Self-Driving and automated transportation can make their lives much easier. If the technology starts to apply in human’s life, we will no longer worry about traffic hazards, because when everyone is using self-driving tech. Making mistakes is almost impossible for a machine if its program is well developed.
