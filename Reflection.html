									<h1>Group Reflection</h1>

								<h2>Wai Yan Htike</h2>
								<p>Although there are rocky patchy in first two weeks, many things go well in later weeks. For instance, we organised the topic we are going to cover week by week and many of my teammates tried to finish before we jump new topics in upcoming weeks. Each week we discussed and decided what to do and what to write individually. We could improve more on communication skills and team building skills. Since I am from Myanmar and my rest teammates are from China, there were slight misunderstanding and communication errors while working on the assignment. </p>
								<h2>Churui Chen</h2>
								<p>For my part of this assignment, I am doing some technology and professional research. The research and generalization for IT technology part took a lot of time. Nevertheless, the result is good. For my article, I have a proper length and a certain degree of professional analysis. The idea of end-product is not only come from the research of my work but also the communication with my teammates. Wai Yan is a good leader who distributed our work reasonably so each of our group mate would have sufficient time to complete the work. In addition, we provide our searching from time to time to our share-page, which is also a significant way for me to conclude the work. Next time, I suggest we can create such page again to share our opinions to make our result better as same as this time.</p>
								<h2>Yihan Zhu </h2>
								<p>For this assessment, it is worth mentioning that the work allocation and cooperation are going well cause by good team leader and members. And our enthusiasm for expending this project is a little bit low may because the difficulty of finishing the whole project in the reality. The most surprising thing is that people are happy to answer the questions in different areas. Also, I gain the experience of organizing 	group activities from this assessment.</p>
								<h2>Yongjian Mao</h2>
								<p>We had a very good team collaboration and communication; everyone arrived the meeting on time and we try to figure out the question together. Our productivity was a little bit low; the weekly work was collected fully until the last day, which left only a little time for our team leader to arrange all our works. Our team including student from completely different subjects, some of them are study economics and we have shared our experiences from our own classes. The teammate who studies economics may be very helpful in planning the future of our food application in A3. Our teammates’ IT professional videos are very useful for my study. I’ve learned several knowledges from these videos. I also notice that not only CS student stressing from their coding assignment. Most of the coding part was in charged by our team leader, he has a strong responsibility and complete his job perfectly which given different works for the rest of the team.</p>
								<h2>Sichuang Wang</h2>
								<p>The entire assessment went smoothly. Everyone in the team was able to complete the assigned tasks on time and participate in every meeting. Everyone is also actively helping other team members. I hope that at the next meeting, everyone can provide more opinions and ideas for the assessment.</p>
								<h2>Wentao Lu</h2>
								<p>It was an unforgettable experience with our team. Our team leader William showed us how a good leader should be. He brought us to work on each part in plan and time measured. I was surprised by his leading skill and I thought it was an important key of our team working. There is one point that I think still can be improved, team mates usually only have communication during group meeting. And then everyone does their own part. I believe our project can be better if there is more discussion among us. </p>
